# DashBid

ETH Online 2023 Project

DashBid is a web3-based data dashboard marketplace, utilizing a reverse auction mechanism.  Here is how it works: A data client creates an order and sets a maximum budget. Once the project is created, a 48-hour auction starts, during which data freelancers offer their prices that are below the client's max budget. After all offers are in, the client selects a freelancer based on their offer, reputation, or a combination of both. The amount equivalent to the accepted offer is locked into a smart contract, and the auction is finished. The chosen freelancer needs to submit the project by the client-defined deadline. Upon successful completion, the funds are released to the freelancer. And if there is any issue, either party can initiate a dispute resolution process.

DashBid's reverse auction mechanism offers Data Clients cost-efficient solutions, a choice from a pool of skilled analysts, and transparent pricing. For Data Freelancers, it ensures secure payment, allows them to set competitive price points based on their expertise, and aids in building a positive reputation in the marketplace. This model provides a balanced platform optimizing value for both clients and freelancers.
